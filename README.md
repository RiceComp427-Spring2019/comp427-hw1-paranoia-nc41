## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - You oversee the football stadium at a university whose team is frequently ranked among the best in the country.
  
- Assets:

  - The team members and fans are the most valuable assets in the stadium. 
  - The wallets in the fans’ pocket and their personal assets like camera.
  
- Threats:

  - If the bomb or weapons are taken into the stadium, it will hurt thousands of people who are watching the games. Nobody can prevent them from hurting people immediately because the police cannot use weapons in the crowd. That is, if they bring dangerous items into the stadium, tragedies will happen.
  
  - If the thieves hide in the group, they can steal the money easily since audience focus on the game and they might not notice that the thieves are stealing their money. Moreover, the stadium will be very crowded, so it is difficult for the police to find the thieves since they can hide into the crowd and then pretend that they are normal fans.
  
- Countermeasures:
  - Do not allow to bring bags into stadium: the bags can put lots of stuff into it and staff could not check them in the short time since 50 thousand audiences (I assumed the capacity of the stadium is 50000.)  are not a small number. Although we can use the machine to scan every bags, it might also take much time and some special material cannot be detected. That is to say, if the items are wrapped into that special material, we cannot know what they are. On the other hand, if the fans cannot bring their bags into the stadium, although there is still a chance to take weapons, it will be less dangerous since the size of the weapons or bomb will be smaller and fire power will be limited. The police or audience can arrest the terrorists by hand.
  
  - Full-body scan before entering the stadium: this is one of the fastest ways to check all the audiences and staffs can make sure that they do not conceal dangerous items in their pockets. Hence, dangerous people cannot make damage or hurt people in the stadium without weapons.
  
  - Design evacuation route: If we cannot prevent tragedies, we need to evacuate people as soon as possible to minimize the losses. Every section needs to have multiple exits and have enough staffs to direct audiences to the nearest exit. Women and children might have higher priority to run out of the stadium because their movement will be slower than others’, so if they evacuate at the same time, they will be left behind and be hurt by people behind them (they might run over them.). The space of the hallway is the biggest issue needed to be considered since if the capacity is not enough, lots of people will be stuck into the courts and hurt. Therefore, the evacuation route(shortest path to the exits) and space of the corridor are significant features to reduce the damage and losses. 
  
  -	Warning sign: Put the signs in front of every seat to make people notice the thieves. By doing so, people will put their wallet into a safe place and look around to find out whether there is a suspicious person nearby. Hence, it is difficult for thieves to steal money from our fans.  
  
## Problem 2
- Scenario: Documents
- Assumptions:
  - As head of IT for an international law firm, you are responsible for a document management system; some documents stored there are about sensitive legal, financial, or political matters.
